### Kotatsu

I was heavily inspired of [kotatsu](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/kotatsu) project. 

This project uses `kotatsu` as run engine.

To run this project locally (with hot reload and other fine kotatsu things)

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

To build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
